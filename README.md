# Faceless

Faceless-'anonymous office '

Faceless is a platform to enable anonymous discussions in a Company or startup or any workplace. The application had login/signup flow like that of Slack. The difference was that every user activity was anonymous to enable free and honest flow of information in company to enable top management to get to know about grievances and problems faced by their employees. Multiple chat channels can be created and then users of that company can chat their anonymously with all employees. Hence it was an anonymous group chat. Chats are appended real time using GCM. Also, users can create posts content to create posts. Messages can be reported as spam. This application was built as a part of Hackathon (TIE Hackathon) in just one day, with backend part using Django.
